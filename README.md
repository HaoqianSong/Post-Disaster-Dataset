# Post-Disaster-Dataset
 A post-disaster survivor dataset is used for UAV post-disaster personnel search and rescue and statistics, it contains the real-world post-disaster UAV images from multiple perspectives, scenes, and distances.


File 879 is a collection of survivors' images of post-disaster ruins for UAV search and rescue. It contains 879 images and corresponding "label" files. 

File 155 is a test dataset from reference [1][2], containing 155 images and corresponding "label" files.

File 112 is the corresponding post-disaster crowd image and the corresponding "label" file.

The "label" files are the tex file in YOLO format.
